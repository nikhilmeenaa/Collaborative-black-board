Reflexive Relation : 
    All (x,x) pairs must be present in the relation.

Irreflesive 
    No (x,x) relation must be present in the relation.

Symmetric Relation : 
    if (x,y) is present in the relation, then (y,x) must be present in the relation as well.

    it is applicable on relation between same set only.

    Total number of symmetric relation are 
        2^n + 2^((n^2-n)/2)

AntiSymmetric Relation : 

    if (x,y) is present in the relation, then (x,y) must not be present in the relation 
    if(x == y) this does not create any problem

Assymetric Relation : 
    if (x,y) is present in the relation , then (x,y) must not be present in the relation.
    
    Assymetric = AntiSymmetric + irreflexive
    

Transitive Relation : 
    if (a,b) and (b,c) are present in the relation then (a , c) must be present in the relation

Equivalent Relation : 
    A relation is said to be equivalence if it is 
    1) Reflexive   2) Symmetric   3) Transitive


Partial Relation : 
    A relation is said to be equivalence if it is 
    1) Reflexive   2) Anti-Symmetric   3) Transitive

Multisets : 
    Sets which may contain a same element multiple number of times , the number of times is called 
    as the muliplicity of that number.

Union : Take maximum of the frequency of the each number from both the table.

Intersection : Take minimum frequency of the each number from both the table.

Difference : Take each number mul(A[x])-mul(A[x]) number of times a number x if 


Summation : Totally plus of all the number present in the two sets.

Cardinality of sets : Total number of distinct elements present in the set.
